The pure numeric CAPTCHA, pure uppercase letter CAPTCHA and alphanuloid mixed CAPTCHA are tested, and resnet50 in the model pool is used for testing, and the accuracy is 99.7%,,

## some tips
- Supports cpu/gpu
- pytorch framework
- easy deploy on PC


## how to run
- git clone or download zip.
- Install the required packages.
- modify parameters for your model or add model.
- Train and test the model.


## attention
- Console interaction, you can choose diyCNN,ResNet etc.
- The dataset has high complexity and contains noise, curve and other interference information.
- The project is not yet complete and there are multiple directions for optimization.
